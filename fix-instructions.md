## 1. Super Admin Login Failure Analysis

**Symptom:** A user with a `super-admin` role successfully submits their login credentials but is immediately redirected or blocked from viewing their dashboard, often seeing an "invalid message" or being sent back to the login page.

### 1.1. Step-by-Step Data Flow

1.  **Login Submission (`LoginPage.jsx`):** The user fills out the form, and the `login` function from `AuthContext` is called with the email and password.
2.  **API Call (`AuthContext.jsx`):** The `login` function makes a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login`.
3.  **Backend Authentication (`authController.js`):** The `loginUser` controller function verifies the credentials against the `User` model. It finds the user, confirms their password and `active` status, and generates a JWT.
4.  **Token Reception (`AuthContext.jsx`):** The frontend receives the user object and the JWT. It stores the token in `localStorage` and dispatches the user object to the context state. The user is now technically "logged in" on the frontend.
5.  **Redirection (`AuthContext.jsx`):** The context calls `navigateToDashboard`, which redirects the browser to `/super-admin/dashboard`.
6.  **Application Reload & Session Check (`AuthContext.jsx`):** As the application reloads for the new page, the `useEffect` hook in `AuthContext` runs. It finds the token in `localStorage` and, as a security best practice, attempts to validate the session by making a `GET` request to `/api/auth/me` to fetch fresh user data.
7.  **Route Guarding (`ProtectedRoute.jsx`):** Simultaneously, the `ProtectedRoute` wrapping the Super Admin layout sees that the `AuthContext` is still in its initial `isLoading: true` state and displays a loading spinner, waiting for the `/api/auth/me` call to complete.
8.  **API Call Failure (`authRoutes.js`):** The `GET` request to `/api/auth/me` fails with a 404 Not Found error because **this route is not defined** in the backend's `authRoutes.js` file.
9.  **Logout (`AuthContext.jsx`):** The `catch` block in the `useEffect` hook interprets the 404 error as a session failure. It dispatches `INITIALIZE_FAIL`, which sets the `user` state to `null` and `isLoading` to `false`.
10. **Access Denied (`ProtectedRoute.jsx`):** The `ProtectedRoute` now sees `isLoading` is `false` and `user` is `null`. It immediately redirects the user back to the `/login` page. This happens so quickly it appears as if the login failed instantly.

### 1.2. Root Cause Determination

The root cause of the login failure is the **missing `GET /api/auth/me` route on the backend**. The frontend's session persistence logic in `AuthContext` is correctly designed to verify the user's session on every application load by fetching up-to-date user information. Without this endpoint, the session validation always fails, causing the user to be logged out immediately after a successful login.

### 1.3. Remediation Plan

The fix requires adding the missing route and its corresponding controller function to the backend.

**Step 1: Add the `getMe` Controller Function**
   - Open the file `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`.
   - Add the following function. The `protect` middleware already does the work of finding the user, so this function just needs to return it.

   ```javascript
   // @desc    Get current logged-in user data
   // @route   GET /api/auth/me
   // @access  Private
   export const getMe = async (req, res) => {
     // The 'protect' middleware has already fetched the user and attached it to req.user
     res.status(200).json(req.user);
   };
   ```

**Step 2: Add the Route Definition**
   - Open the file `backend/src/routes/authRoutes.js`.
   - Import the new `getMe` function from the controller.
   - Add the new route definition. It must be protected by the `protect` middleware.

   ```javascript
   import { registerUser, loginUser, googleAuthSuccess, getMe } from '../controllers/authController.js';
   import { protect, admin } from '../middleware/authMiddleware.js';

   // ... (other routes)

   // This is the new, critical route for session persistence.
   router.get('/me', protect, getMe);
   ```

**Step 3: Restart the Backend Server**
   - After saving both files, restart the backend server to apply the changes.

## 2. Job Card Visibility Analysis

**Symptom:** Jobs are being created successfully in the admin panel, but they do not appear on the public candidate homepage (`/`).

### 2.1. Step-by-Step Data Flow

1.  **Page Load (`CandidateHomePage.jsx`):** The component mounts and its `useEffect` hook calls the `fetchJobs` function.
2.  **API Call (`CandidateHomePage.jsx`):** The `fetchJobs` function makes a `GET` request to the `/api/jobs` endpoint to retrieve the list of jobs.
3.  **Backend Routing (`jobRoutes.js`):** The `GET` request to `/api/jobs` is handled by the `getAllJobs` function from `jobController.js`.
4.  **Database Query (`jobController.js`):** The `getAllJobs` function executes a query against the `Job` collection in the database.

    ```javascript
    // File: backend/src/controllers/jobController.js

    export const getAllJobs = async (req, res) => {
      try {
        const jobs = await Job.find({ status: 'Open' }).sort({ createdAt: -1 });
        res.json(jobs);
      } catch (error) {
        // ...
      }
    };
    ```

5.  **Data Rendering (`CandidateHomePage.jsx`):** The frontend receives the list of jobs from the API and stores it in the `jobs` state variable. The component then maps over this array, passing each `job` object to a `JobListing` component, which renders the card.

### 2.2. Root Cause Determination

The data flow analysis reveals that the code is **correctly implemented** at every step.
- The frontend correctly calls the `GET /api/jobs` endpoint.
- The backend route correctly maps to the `getAllJobs` controller.
- The `getAllJobs` controller correctly queries the database for all documents in the `Job` collection where the `status` field is exactly equal to **`'Open'`**.

Therefore, the bug is not in the code but in the **data itself**. The jobs that are being created in the admin panel and are expected to be public **do not have their `status` field set to `'Open'`**. They likely have a different status (e.g., `'Closed'`, `'On Hold'`, or the field might be missing entirely if the model default is not being applied), which causes them to be excluded by the database query.

### 2.3. Remediation Plan

The fix involves ensuring that any job intended to be public is created with or updated to have the `Open` status.

**Step 1: Verify Job Status in the Database**
   - Using a database GUI (like MongoDB Compass) or the mongo shell, inspect the `jobs` collection.
   - Find the documents for the jobs that are not appearing.
   - Examine the `status` field for these documents. You will find it is not set to `'Open'`.

**Step 2: Correct the Data or the Creation Process**
   - **Manual Correction:** For existing jobs, manually update the `status` field to `'Open'` in the database.
   - **Process Correction:** Review the administrative UI where jobs are created or managed. Ensure that when a new job is created, its `status` is defaulted to `'Open'`. If there is a form for editing jobs, make sure the status can be changed to `'Open'` and that this change is correctly persisted to the database.
